# Professional-Portfolio

A portfolio for all of my personal coding projects.

This project has three pages: an "About Me" page, "Portfolio" page, and a "Contact Me" page.

The "About Me" page has several photos and brief descriptions about myself and my work ethic.

The "Portfolio" page has several descriptions of real projects I've built or am working on, though only the button linking to my Scratch game works, due to not knowing how to start a download or set a bookmark.

The "Contact Me" page has a form to input a name, an email, and a message to be sent to me, though this doesn't function yet. This page also includes a link to my facebook profile.

All three pages also contain a navbar to navigate between the pages and a sticky footer at the bottom of the page.
