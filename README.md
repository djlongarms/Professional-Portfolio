# Professional-Portfolio

A portfolio for all of my personal coding projects.

This project has three pages: an "About Me" page, "Portfolio" page, and a "Contact Me" page.

The "About Me" page has several photos and brief descriptions about myself and my work ethic.

The "Portfolio" page has a description of the Scratch game I worked on for class, as well as a link to a Board Game search engine a few classmates and I made for a class project

The "Contact Me" page has a form to input a name, an email, and a message to be sent to me, though this doesn't function yet. This page also includes a link to my facebook profile.

All three pages also contain a navbar to navigate between the pages and a sticky footer at the bottom of the page.
